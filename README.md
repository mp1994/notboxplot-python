# notBoxPlot Python

Inspired by [notBoxPlot](https://github.com/raacampbell/notBoxPlot) for MATLAB, this repository contains the Python 3 implementation based on matplotlib.

notBoxPlot is a data visualization function that goes beyond conventional box-plot like plots. It allows to visualize both statistic descriptors as well as single data points for a distribution, giving more information. 

The user can deeply control the aspect of the plot with several (optional) parameters to the function. Many plots can be combined within the same figure/subplot to compare distributions!

### Features
* Highly customazible data plots for enhanced data visualization
* Built-in demo, just run `python3 notBoxPlot.py` for an example.
* Styling options include different colors and hatch patterns for high-quality plots.
### Coming soon

* Integration of `scipy` to provide built-in statistics to quantitavely compare distributions and plot significance bars and/or p-values.
